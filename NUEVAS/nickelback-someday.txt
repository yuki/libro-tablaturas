Bm                     G                     A
How the hell'd we wind up like this
           D
Why weren't we able
Bm              G                        A
To see the signs that we missed
            D
Try and turn the tables
Bm                G                     A
I wish you'd unclench your fists
          D
And unpack your suitcase
Bm                      G                      A
Lately theres been too much of this
            D
But don't think it's too late
E
Nothings wrong
                 A
Just as long as you know that someday I will


G              D
Someday, Somehow
A                                  E
I'm gonna make it alright but not alright now
G                       A                   Bm                       A
I know your're  wondering away (your're the only one who knows that)
G               D
Someday, Somehow
A                                 E
I'm gonna make it alright but not alright now
G                      A                  Bm
I know you're wondering away


        Bm                             G                  A
Well I hope that since we're here anyway
             D
We could end up saying
Bm                            G                 A
Things we've always needed to say
               D
So we could end up staying
Bm                    G                     A
Now the story's played out like this
              D
Just like a paperback novel
Bm                  G                   A
Lets rewrite an ending that fits
              D
Instead of hollywood horror
E
Nothings wrong
              A
Just as long as you know that someday I will


G              D
Someday, Somehow
A                                 E
I'm gonna make it alright but not alright now
G                   A                   Bm                       A
I know your're wondering away (your're the only one who knows that)
G               D
Someday, Somehow
A                                E

G                   A                 Bm
I know you're wondering away
