[Palm mute]So much for my happy ending
[Bm]oh o[G]h, [D]oh [A]oh, oh oh... 

Let's start this [Bm]over
It's not like we're [G]dead
Was it something I [D]did?
Was it something You [A]said?
Don't leave me [Bm]hanging
In a city so [G]dead
held up so [D]high
On such a breakable [A]thread
 

You were a[G]ll the things I [D]thought I knew
And [G]I thought we could [A]be 


CHORUS
You were [G]everything, [D]everything that I [A]wanted 
We were [G]meant to be, [D]supposed to be, but we [A]lost it
all the [G]memories, so close to me, just [A]fade awa[Bm]y
All this time you wer[G]e pretending
[D]So much for my [A]happy ending
[Bm]oh oh[G], oh [D]oh, [A]oh oh... 


You've got your dumb friends 
you know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult 
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do 


You were all the things I thought of you 
And I thought we could be 

CHORUS 


[Bm]It's nice to know you were [G]there
Thanks for asking like you [A]cared
And making me feel like I was the [G]only one
[A]It's nice to know we had it [G]all
Thanks for watching as i [D]fall
And letting me know we were [A]done  


CHORUS X 2 


[Bm]oh o[G]h, [D]oh oh[A], oh oh...
