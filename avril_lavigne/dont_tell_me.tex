[E  C#m  B  A  x2]{}

[E]You held my [C#m]hand and walked me 
[B]home, I [A]know.
[E]Why you gave me the [C#m]kiss it was something like 
[B]this, that made me go [A]oh-oh.
[E]You wiped my [C#m]tears, got rid of all my 
[B]fears, why did you have to [A]go?
[E]Cause it wasn't enough [C#m]to take up some of my 
[B]love, cause you're so hard to [A]trust.


Pre-Chorus:
Did [C#m]I not tell you that [B]I'm not like that?
You're the [A]one who gives it all [B]away.

Chorus:
[C#m]Did you think that I was [A]gonna 
give it up to [E]you, this [B]time?
[C#m]Did you think that I was [A]something 
I was gonna [E]do and [B]cry?
[C#m]Don't try to [A]tell me what to [E]do,
Don't try to [B]tell me what to [A]say,
Your better off that [B]way.


Don't think that your charmin the 
fact that your arm is now around my neck.
I got you in my pants I'll have to kick 
your ass and make you never forget.
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought 
I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset.
Get out of my head, get off of my bed 
yeah thats what I said.


Pre-Chorus

Chorus


[A]This guilt trip that you put me on won't, 
[E]mess me up but you're no wrong.
[C#m]Any thoughts of you and me have gone [A]away[B].


Chorus
