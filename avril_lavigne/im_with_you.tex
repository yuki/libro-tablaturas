I'm s[F#m]tanding on the bridge
I'm w[D5]aiting in the dark
I t[F#m]hought that you'd be here by no[D5]w
There's no[F#m]thing but the rain
No f[D5]ootsteps on the ground
I'm l[F#m]istening but there's no s[D5]ound


[E]Isn't anyone trying to f[D]ind me
[E]Won't somebody come take me h[D]ome


CHORUS:
[D]It's a d[A]amn c[Bm]old n[D]ight
[D]I try to figure o[A]ut t[Bm]his l[D]ife
[D]Won't you [A]{}  take me by the h[Bm]and take me s[D]omewhere new
[D]I don't k[F#m]now who you [E]are but I[D]{}
[D]I'm with [F#m]you  [D]{}
[D]I'm with [F#m]you  [D]{}


I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know
Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone


Isn't anyone trying to find me
Won't somebody come take me home
