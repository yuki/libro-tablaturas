[Em]  Cause I know you're worth it,[Asus2] you're worth it, yeah


[D]  If I can say what I wanna s[A]ay, I say I wanna blow[Bm] you away
  Be with you every n[G]ight, am I squeezin you too t[D]ight
[D]  If I can say what I wanna s[A]ee, I wanna see you go dow[Bm]n on one knee
  Marry me tod[G]ay, cause I'm wishin my life aw[Em]ay

[D A Bm G x2]{}


[Bm]  They don't do me any g[G]ood, it's just a waste of t[D]ime
  What use is it to [Asus2] you  what's on my m[Bm]ind
[Bm]  If it ain't comin [G]out, we're not going anywh[D]ere
  So why can't I just [Asus2]tell you that I c[Em]are

[Em]  Cause I know you're worth it,[Asus2] you're worth it, yeah
