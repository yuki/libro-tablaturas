INTRO G C9 D

[G]Another turning point a [C9]fork stuck in the [D]road
[G]Time grabs you by the wrist [C9]directs you where to [D]go

[Em]So make the [D]best of these days and [C9]don't ask [G]why
[Em]It's not a qu[D]estion but a [C9]lesson learned in [G]time


CHORUS
[Em]It's something unpre[G]dictable [Em]in the end it's [G]right
[Em]I hope you have the [D]time of your [G]life.

Verse 2:
[G]So take the photographs and [C9]stillframes in your [D]mind
Hang it on a shelf; it could've been good times

[Em]Tatoos and [D]memories and [C9]asking on [G]trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while


CHORUS x2
