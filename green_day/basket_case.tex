[E]Do you have the [B]time
to [C#m]listen to me [G#]whine
[A]about nothing and[E] everything
all at [B]once

[E]I am one of [B]those
me[C#m]lodramatic [G#]fools
neu[A]rotic to the [E]bone
no doubt about [B]it


Chorus:
[A]sometimes I [B]give myself the [E]creeps
[A]sometimes my [B]mind plays tricks on [E]me
It [A]all keeps adding [B]up
I [E]think I'm cracking [C#m]up
Am [A]I just para[B]noid?
I'm ju[E B C#m B x4]st stoned


I went to a shrink
to analyze my dreams.
She says it's lack of sex
that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
And quit my whining cause
it's bringing her down.


CHORUS

E B C\#min B x4
    A          B
Grasping to control
so you better hold on
E B C\#min G\# A E B x2
