   [E]My girl, my girl, don't [A]lie to [G]me
   Tell me [B]where did you sleep last [E]night
   [E]In the pines, in the pines
   Where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
   I would [B]shiver the whole night [E]through


   My girl, my girl, where will you go
   I'm going where the cold wind blows
   In the pines, in the pines
   Where the sun don't ever shine
   I would shiver the whole night through
   
   
   Her husband, was a hard working man
   Just about a mile from here
   His head was found in a driving wheel
   But his body never was found
   
   
   My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
   Tell me where did you sleep last night
   In the pines, in the pines
   Where the sun don't ever shine
   I would shiver the whole night through
   
   
   My girl, my girl, where will you go
   I'm going where the cold wind blows
   In the pines, in the pines
   Where the sun don't ever shine
   I would shiver the whole night through
    
   
   My girl, my girl, where will ya go
   I'm going where the cold wind blows
   In the pines, the pines
   The sun, the shine
   I'll shiver the whole night through
