INTRO
[B5]


[B5]now i will tell you what i[B5]'ve done for you
[B5]50 thousand tears i've cr[B5]ied
[B5]screaming deceiving and b[B5]leeding for you
[B5]and you still won't h[B5]ear me


don't want your hand this time i'll save myself
maybe i'll wake up for once
not tormented daily defeated by you
just when i thought i'd reached the bottom

i've[A5] got to break thr[B5 G5 D5]ough
i'[A5]m going under[B5]{}


blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
so i don't know what's real and what's not
always confusing the thoughts in my head
so i can't trust myself anymore
