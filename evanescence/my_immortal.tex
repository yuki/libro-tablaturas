[A]I'm so tired of being [C#m]here
[A]suppressed by all of my [C#m]childish fears
[A]and if you have to leave
I [C#m]wish that you could just leave
[A]because your presence still lingers here
[C#m]and it won't leave me alone


Pre-CHORUS:
[F#m]   These [C#m]wounds won't seem to heal
[F#m]    this [C#m]pain is just too real
[F#m]there's [C#m]just too much that [E]time cannot erase


CHORUS:
[F#m]When you [D]cried I'd [E]wipe away [C#m]all of your tears
[F#m]When you'd [D]scream I'd [E]fight away [C#m]all of your fears
[F#m]And I've [D]held your [E]hand through [C#m]all of these years
[F#m]but you sti[D]ll hav[E]e all of me [A C#m A C#m]


[A]You used to captivat[C#m]e me by your resonating light
but now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me


Pre-CHORUS


CHORUS


[D]I've tried so [F#m]hard to tell myse[E]lf that you're gon[D]e
[F#m]but though you're still [C#m]with me
[D]I've been alon[E]e all along[F#m D E C#m]


CHORUS
